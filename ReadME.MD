# Solar System 3D Visualization

This project is a 3D visualization of the solar system built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). It includes interactive features such as speed control for planets, camera movement, zoom functionality, and orbit visualization.

---

## Features

1. **3D Solar System**:
   - Realistic representation of planets and their orbits.
   - Textures applied to planets for a detailed look.

2. **Interactive Controls**:
   - Speed control for individual planets.
   - Camera movement using `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys.
   - Zoom functionality using the scroll wheel.

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - UI adapts to different screen sizes.
   - Landscape mode enforced for mobile devices.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/solar-system.git
   cd solar-system
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the project using `npx serve`:

   ```bash
   npx serve
   ```

4. Open the project in your browser:

   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

## Controls

### Keyboard Controls

* **W**: Move camera up.
* **S**: Move camera down.
* **A**: Move camera left.
* **D**: Move camera right.

### Mouse Controls

* **Scroll Wheel**: Zoom in/out.
* **Drag**: Rotate the camera.

---

## How It Works

### Planets and Orbits

* Planets are created using `THREE.SphereGeometry` and textured using `THREE.TextureLoader`.
* Orbits are visualized using `THREE.Line` with elliptical paths.

### Camera Controls

* Camera movement and zoom are handled in `cameraControls.js` using event listeners for keyboard and mouse inputs.

### Responsive Design

* Media queries in `style.css` ensure the UI adapts to different screen sizes.
* Portrait mode displays a message prompting users to rotate their device.
